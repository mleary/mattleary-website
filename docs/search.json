    "text": "After many months (years?) of not really touching my personal website, I am working to update my website and truly delve into using quarto for analysis and publication. This initial post will be a short summary of my efforts to get started, document some of the resources I found and used, and a starting point for what will *hopefully* become a regularly updated post.\n\nLessons learned\n\nI had an existing template, after a few hours I was able to follow Sam Csik tutorial (to help me create blog section on the website.\n\nUsed this tutorial\n\nUsing a custom domain is relatively simple, but it took some configuring to get it right.\n\nGithub docs\n\nUsed the section entitled Configuring an apex domain\n\nRandom YouTube video that helped visual the process\n\nRealized I might want to setup a Github Actions workflow instead of rendering locally. Not sure on that yet.\nConsolidating\n\nI have created several other websites with Github. Debating if I want to link to those, move that content into this website, or refactor those as quarto webpages.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources used\n\nhttps://beamilz.com/"

I work regularly with R and Python, but R will always be my preferred language for analysis and machine learning. I am frequently working with SQL and Git (DevOps or Github), and have experience with cloud computing such as AWS, Azure, and Databricks.\nOutside of work, I am the proud father of two tiny humans and an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan. I previously worked in public policy/public relations, and spent a few years in the Army*.\n*Fun fact, you run and workout a LOT less when no one is yelling at you to do so."
