    "text": "Using Open AI for image generation\nAs I expected, it was incredibly easy to use the Open AI api with just a few lines of code. Each each call only cost a few pennies (I saw 3-4 cents per image) and took 5-10 seconds to return a response. So overall, very inexpensive and quick to iterate with new different images.\nI started with a vague prompt about a bear saying “please bear with me”, and slowly refined it.\n\n\nhide / show code\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\nfrom secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.images.generate(\n  model=\"dall-e-3\",\n  prompt=\"I want a picture of a bear in construction gear sitting at a computer typing code.  I want a message at the top of the image that says 'Please BEAR with us, this site is under construction. The idea is for this to be cartoonish and funny!  Please add this exact phrase at the bottom 'Created with DALL-E'\",\n  size=\"1024x1024\",\n  quality=\"standard\",\n  n=1,\n)\n\nimage_url = response.data[0].url\nimage_url \n\n\n'https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-QwvrbKaSi0VeflwsDx1dYz8t/user-xeCmfMW6XAJBDsWzkXkIRsNp/img-2xf5B8J4ZbuylSvNHcSRPInx.png?st=2024-02-17T18%3A19%3A44Z&se=2024-02-17T20%3A19%3A44Z&sp=r&sv=2021-08-06&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=6aaadede-4fb3-4698-a8f6-684d7786b067&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2024-02-17T18%3A56%3A39Z&ske=2024-02-18T18%3A56%3A39Z&sks=b&skv=2021-08-06&sig=ldgus5CfsRP6VGOW75XUf%2B2IiRF7C8e7wCXEYp3hFUY%3D'\n\n\nAnd just like that, you have a url where you can view the generated image and download it locally. A few things to note that I found interesting:\n\nAs of February 2024, the image will stay up for one hour per the DALL-E documentation.\nYou’ll notice that while the image outputs are impressive, the text generation was surprisingly bad. Even with direct prompts to include a specific saying, it often got the phrase wrong, misspelled words or even made up words. Some quick research confirmed it’s a common occurrence. I read some explanations for why, but I did not go deep enough to confirm exactly why. I am interested to read more on that."

This initial post will be a short summary of my efforts to get started, document some of the resources I found and used, and a starting point for what will *hopefully* become a regularly updated post.\n\nLessons learned\n\nI had an existing template, after a few hours I was able to follow blogs by Sam Csik and Bea Milz to help me create a seperate posts section, add a footer, and generally make some customizations I really liked.\n\nSam Csik blog\nBea Milz website I reviewed for ideas and code snippets\n\nUsing a custom domain is relatively simple, but it took some configuring to get it right.\n\nGithub docs\n\nUsed the section entitled Configuring an apex domain\n\nRandom YouTube video that helped visual the process\n\nRealized I might want to setup a Github Actions workflow instead of rendering locally. Not sure on that yet.\nBring over old .Rmd files used in my previous {blogdown} format was clunky\n\nNot sure if it was simply a copy paste issue, but I took an old post and tried to move it over. Quarto seemed to have some new syntax and it proved to be a little bit of a hassle. Again, this might have been user error on the first go round but I might just focus on starting fresh moving forward.\n\nConsolidating\n\nI have created several other websites with Github. Debating if I want to link to those, move that content into this website, or refactor those as quarto webpages."

    "title": "Generating my resume with {pagedown}",
    "section": "Main efforts",
    "text": "Main efforts\nHere some of my major steps I took to fully leverage {pagedown} resume template.\n\nUpdating the CSS\nWith limited CSS experience, this step took the longest as I explored CSS syntax and the resulting output. I’ll ignore the actual CSS code and the changes I made, but the process of adding a custom CSS file was simple. First, create a .css file with the changes you want to make. After that, add a few lines of code to the YAML header of the markdown template (seen below).\n\noutput:\n\npagedown::html_resume:\n\ncss: \\['css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_html.css', 'resume'\\]\nNote that with this setup, the base CSS template is still used but is overwritten by my custom CSS files. I also created a css folder to house the files, which appeared to be a best practice.\n\n\nCreating an Excel file for data\nRather than hard coding my work and education experience in the Markdown document, I liked the approach of creating a separate excel file with all the necessary data for my resume. This way it is easier to update my experience and in theory I could use that file to populate different resume versions, websites, etc..\n\n\nProducing multiple versions\nI wanted to create two different versions of my resume, one with color and a plain version for easier printing. That said, I did not want to maintain to separate RMarkdown documents since that would require me to update TWO documents to ensure they were both always up to date. While this wouldn’t be an overwhelming burden, I also suspected it would lead to two versions with minor differences.\nUsing the render function from the **rmarkdown** package, I was able to easily update both versions at the same time. With this function, you can take an rmarkdown file and control some of the output settings. For example, I was able to control the output file name, the css settings, and any individual parameter settings used in the YAML settings.\n\nrmarkdown::render(input = \"resume.Rmd\",\n  output_file = \"index.html\",\n  output_options = list(css = c('css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_html.css', 'resume'),\n  self_contained = FALSE\n  ),\n  params = list(doctype = \"HTML\")\n)\n\nrmarkdown::render(input = \"resume.Rmd\",\n  output_file = \"mleary_resume.html\",\n  output_options = list(\n    css = c('css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_pdf.css', 'resume')\n  ),\n  params = list(doctype = \"PDF\")\n)\nThis was really helpful to learn for future projects. Saving the output as a different name is something that could helpful in other circumstances. For routine reports that might be ran periodically, it would be helpful to use this function to save the output with the current date. Another use case would be to create template format and than create multiple outputs for a list of items using the **purrr** package."

My major takeaways are listed below.\n* Google is your friend. The {pagedown} documentation was great, but finding Nick’s example really helped me develop a resume I liked.\n* Rmarkdown is awesome. I already thought this, but a simple trick like rendering an existing Rmarkdown with specific parameters means I can know do even more with the package.\n* CSS styling is nuanced, but it also adds a lot. I am not a CSS expert, but with some simple research and a LOT of experimentation I was able to quickly make changes. I’ve used CSS to create a custom {rmarkdown} template at work, and that little addition really makes the report stand out."

    "text": "Hi!\nI am a data scientist working in the insurance industry and I enjoy building tools that help people work more efficiently. I work regularly with R and Python, but R will always be my preferred language for analysis and machine learning. I am frequently working with SQL and Git (DevOps or Github), and have experience with cloud computing such as AWS, Azure, and Databricks.\nOutside of work, I am the proud father of two tiny humans and an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan. I previously worked in public policy/public relations, and spent a few years in the Army*.\n*Fun fact, you run and workout a LOT less when no one is yelling at you to do so."
