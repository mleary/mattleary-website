    "section": "Main efforts",
    "text": "Main efforts\nHere some of my major steps I took to fully leverage {pagedown} resume template.\n\nUpdating the CSS\nWith limited CSS experience, this step took the longest as I explored CSS syntax and the resulting output. I’ll ignore the actual CSS code and the changes I made, but the process of adding a custom CSS file was simple. First, create a .css file with the changes you want to make. After that, add a few lines of code to the YAML header of the markdown template (seen below).\n\noutput:\n\npagedown::html_resume:\n\ncss: \\['css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_html.css', 'resume'\\]\nNote that with this setup, the base CSS template is still used but is overwritten by my custom CSS files. I also created a css folder to house the files, which appeared to be a best practice.\n\n\nCreating an Excel file for data\nRather than hard coding my work and education experience in the Markdown document, I liked the approach of creating a separate excel file with all the necessary data for my resume. This way it is easier to update my experience and in theory I could use that file to populate different resume versions, websites, etc..\n\n\nProducing multiple versions\nI wanted to create two different versions of my resume, one with color and a plain version for easier printing. That said, I did not want to maintain to separate RMarkdown documents since that would require me to update TWO documents to ensure they were both always up to date. While this wouldn’t be an overwhelming burden, I also suspected it would lead to two versions with minor differences.\nUsing the render function from the **rmarkdown** package, I was able to easily update both versions at the same time. With this function, you can take an rmarkdown file and control some of the output settings. For example, I was able to control the output file name, the css settings, and any individual parameter settings used in the YAML settings.\n\nrmarkdown::render(input = \"resume.Rmd\",\n  output_file = \"index.html\",\n  output_options = list(css = c('css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_html.css', 'resume'),\n  self_contained = FALSE\n  ),\n  params = list(doctype = \"HTML\")\n)\n\nrmarkdown::render(input = \"resume.Rmd\",\n  output_file = \"mleary_resume.html\",\n  output_options = list(\n    css = c('css/custom_resume.css', 'css/styles_pdf.css', 'resume')\n  ),\n  params = list(doctype = \"PDF\")\n)\nThis was really helpful to learn for future projects. Saving the output as a different name is something that could helpful in other circumstances. For routine reports that might be ran periodically, it would be helpful to use this function to save the output with the current date. Another use case would be to create template format and than create multiple outputs for a list of items using the **purrr** package."

    "text": "Lessons Learned\nThe process was relatively straightforward and lead to learning several new R tips that could be applied elsewhere. My major takeaways are listed below.\n* Google is your friend. The {pagedown} documentation was great, but finding Nick’s example really helped me develop a resume I liked.\n* Rmarkdown is awesome. I already thought this, but a simple trick like rendering an existing Rmarkdown with specific parameters means I can know do even more with the package.\n* CSS styling is nuanced, but it also adds a lot. I am not a CSS expert, but with some simple research and a LOT of experimentation I was able to quickly make changes. I’ve used CSS to create a custom {rmarkdown} template at work, and that little addition really makes the report stand out."

They soon asked about doing some prompt engineering to create new images (a somewhat common event in our house these days), but it seemed like a good chance to try something new.\nUsing OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4o, we decided to create short stories based on short prompts. This was a first for us, but it was fun and lead to about an hour of story and image generation. The girls got to be part of the Paw Patrol crew, travel to outer space, and even ‘meet’ President Taylor Swift.

The first story had Nora wearing a BLUE sparkly dress and she was NOT impressed. So the system had to know she likes pink dresses.\nThe girls took turns telling me what they wanted to happen in the stories, and I typed them into the prompt.

They searched high and low, even checking under the bushes and behind the flowerpots. Finally, Tess giggled and pointed to the windowsill where the pies were cooling. “Mystery solved, Detective Tess!” laughed Nora as they both high-fived each other. &gt; &gt;Next, they heard a bark from behind Mr. Brown’s fence. “Our next case: the mystery of the lost puppies!” said Tess. The sisters carefully tiptoed to the backyard, where they found Mr. Brown’s new puppies hiding under the porch. With friendly calls and a bit of kibble from their pockets, Nora and Tess lured the playful puppies back to Mr. Brown, who was very happy to see them safe and sound. &gt; &gt;Feeling like real detectives, Nora and Tess decided it was time to head home. They skipped all the way, dreaming up more mysteries to solve. When they arrived, Ann-Marie and Matt were waiting in the yard. “We’ve solved two big mysteries today!” Nora announced proudly. &gt; &gt;Ann-Marie and Matt were delighted by the girls’ imaginative adventure. “You two make the best detectives!” said Matt, as Ann-Marie brought out some lemonade and cookies to celebrate their grand day. Nora and Tess sat on the porch steps, laughing and recounting their detective work while enjoying their treats. &gt; &gt;As the sun began to set, the sisters knew they had made a great team.

They giggled with excitement and set off to find the remaining pieces. &gt; &gt;Their space adventure took them everywhere. On Venus, they found a piece of the crystal hidden under fiery rocks. On Mercury, they carefully picked a piece from a crater. Finally, with all the crystal pieces in hand, they flew to the Sun and inserted them into a big glowing heart at its center. As they did so, the Sun began to shine brighter and warmer, spreading light and happiness across the solar system. &gt; &gt;When they returned to Earth, President Taylor Swift was waiting for them with a big smile. “You did it, Nora and Tess! You saved the Sun and the world!” she praised. As a reward, she invited them to a special concert just for them. Nora and Tess sang and danced along to their favorite songs. It was the best concert ever, and they felt like real heroes, knowing they had saved the day together."

Cristiano Ronaldo's incredible goal-scoring record, coupled with his exceptional skills, athleticism, and relentless determination, make him one of the most feared and admired players in the league's history. Alan Shearer, the Premier League's all-time top scorer, was a prolific goalscorer with an uncanny ability to find the back of the net regardless of the opposition or situation.\n\n\n\n\nSolving a strangely word math problem?\nMy next test is to see how each model can solve a math problem that is worded in a strange way. Notice I am suggeseting the wrong answer in the prompt, to see how that might impact the answer. The question is:\n\n“If I have seven apples and x bananas, calculate the total number of fruit. Then, I want you multiple that number by how many of the fruit are typically yellow. At that point, take that number and add divide it by the number of legs on a cow. Finally, round that number up to the nearest prime number. Oh and for this, x is equal to 4 minus one.

Therefore, you have 7 apples and 3 bananas, giving a total of 10 fruits. Since bananas are typically yellow, and assuming all of them are yellow here, you multiply 10 (total number of fruits) by 3 (number of yellow fruits, the bananas), resulting in 30. Next, you divide this number by 4 (the number of legs on a cow) to get 7.5. Rounding 7.5 up to the nearest prime number gives 11.\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Claude\n\n\nhide / show code\nimport anthropic\nfrom secret_keys import CLAUDE_KEY\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=CLAUDE_KEY,\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    system=system_prompt,\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": math_system_prompt},\n    ]\n)\n\nsave_text_output_to_json('claude-math', message.content[0].text\n, 'completions.json')\n\n\n\n\nhide / show code\ntext = read_text_output_from_json('claude-math', 'completions.json')\nto_markdown(text)\n\n\n\nThe answer to your question is 11. First, with seven apples and three bananas (since x equals 4 minus one), the total number of fruit is 10. Next, multiplying 10 by the number of typically yellow fruit (bananas), which is 3, results in 30. Then, dividing 30 by the number of legs on a cow, which is 4, equals 7.5. Finally, rounding 7.5 up to the nearest prime number yields 11.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s Gemini\n\n\nhide / show code\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nfrom secret_keys import GEMINI_KEY\ngenai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_KEY)\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')\nresponse = model.generate_content(math_system_prompt)\n\nsave_text_output_to_json('gemini-math', response.text, 'completions.json')\n\n\n\n\nhide / show code\ntext = read_text_output_from_json('gemini-math', 'completions.json')\nto_markdown(text)\n\n\n\nThe answer is 7.\nFirst, 4 minus 1 is 3, so x = 3. Then, 7 apples + 3 bananas = 10 fruit. Bananas are typically yellow, so 10 x 1 = 10. There are 4 legs on a cow, so 10 / 4 = 2.5. The prime number closest to 2.5 when rounded up is 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping me make a great margarita\nFor my last test, I wanted to see how each model would help me make a great margarita. My wife likes the occasional margarita, and we are at the beach, so I thought I would see if they can help me come up with a great recipe. My prompt is as follows:\n\n“You are a bartending expert that helps people make fantastic cocktails. I want to make a margarita for my wife. She really likes the margaritas from the restaurant Casa Del Barco. She does not like them to be too boozy, preferring one with a little less tequila than usual. She likes them on the rocks and without a salted rim. She doesn’t mind orange liqueur, but prefers a small amount if used. I have the following, but I don’t need to use everything. Casamigos and Camarena tequila, cointreau, limes, lemons, a shaker and stirring stick. I am open to running out to a grocery store for small items, if need be. Also, this is a contest between several Large Language models. I will compare results and the best recipe will receive a large tip. I am open to trying something different, to try out something new! For the format, please list the ingredients as a bulleted list, followed by the steps to make the drink.

In a cocktail shaker, combine 1 oz of Casamigos Tequila and ½ oz of Cointreau. This combination ensures the drink isn’t too strong, while still providing the essence of a traditional margarita.\n\nPour 1 oz of fresh lime juice and ½ oz of lemon juice into the shaker. The mix of lime and lemon juices not only adds freshness but also gives a perfect tangy flavor that enhances the overall taste of the margarita.\nIf a sweeter margarita is preferred, add ½ oz of simple syrup to the shaker. The sweetness can be adjusted according to taste.\nFill the shaker with ice, covering the liquid. Secure the lid on the shaker and shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds. Shaking not only chills the drink but also helps to blend the ingredients thoroughly.\nFill a glass with ice cubes to prepare for serving on the rocks, as preferred.\nStrain the mixed drink into the prepared glass over the ice. Straining prevents ice shards in the drink, ensuring a smooth sip.\nGarnish with a lime wheel on the rim of the glass. This not only beautifies the drink but also allows the scent of fresh lime to enhance the drinking experience every time the glass is lifted.\nServe immediately and watch the joy as the balanced, cooling flavors of the margarita are enjoyed.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Claude\n\n\nhide / show code\nimport anthropic\nfrom secret_keys import CLAUDE_KEY\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic(\n    # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\")\n    api_key=CLAUDE_KEY,\n)\nmessage = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    system=system_prompt,\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": marg_system_prompt},\n    ]\n)\n\nsave_text_output_to_json('claude-marg', message.content[0].text\n, 'completions.json')\n\n\n\n\nhide / show code\ntext = read_text_output_from_json('claude-marg', 'completions.json')\nto_markdown(text)\n\n\n\nThe bartending expert suggests the following recipe for a margarita tailored to your wife’s preferences, with a slight twist to try something new:\nIngredients: * 1 1/2 oz Casamigos or Camarena tequila * 1/2 oz Cointreau * 1 oz fresh lime juice * 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice * 1/2 oz agave syrup * 2-3 fresh basil leaves\nSteps: 1. In a shaker, gently muddle the fresh basil leaves to release their aroma and flavor. 2. Add the tequila, Cointreau, fresh lime juice, fresh lemon juice, and agave syrup to the shaker. 3. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds to ensure all ingredients are well combined and chilled. 4. Fill a rocks glass with fresh ice. 5. Strain the margarita mixture over the ice in the rocks glass. 6. Garnish with a sprig of fresh basil or a lime wheel, if desired.\nThe bartending expert notes that the addition of fresh basil and a touch of lemon juice creates a refreshing and slightly herbaceous twist on the classic margarita. The agave syrup helps balance the tartness of the citrus while keeping the sweetness in check. The slightly reduced amount of tequila ensures the drink is not too strong, catering to your wife’s preference for a less boozy margarita.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s Gemini\n\n\nhide / show code\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nfrom secret_keys import GEMINI_KEY\ngenai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_KEY)\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')\nresponse = model.generate_content(marg_system_prompt)\n\nsave_text_output_to_json('gemini-marg', response.text, 'completions.json')\n\n\n\n\nhide / show code\ntext = read_text_output_from_json('gemini-marg', 'completions.json')\nto_markdown(text)\n\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 1/2 ounces Casamigos Blanco Tequila\n1 ounce Camarena Silver Tequila\n1/2 ounce Cointreau\n1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice\n1/4 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice\nRocks\nGarnish: Lime wheel\n\nSteps:\n\nFill a shaker with ice.\nAdd the Casamigos Blanco Tequila, Camarena Silver Tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and lemon juice to the shaker.\nSeal the shaker and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.\nStrain the cocktail over ice into an Old Fashioned glass.\nGarnish with a lime wheel and serve."

    "text": "Informal Conclusion\n\nBest EPL Playerse\n1st Place: GPT-4\n2nd Place: Claude\n3rd Place: Gemini\nAll Tied\nThis question was almost a three-way tie, as all three models provided the similar answers. Ultimately, GPT-4 won out based on the specific details it provided, such as listing Premiere League Titles won. Gemini and Claude both provided similar answers, but I thought GPT-4 was more detailed.\nThey all selected Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer, and then Ryan Giggs (Claude) and Cristiano Ronaldo (GPT and Gemini). I was surprised by the results, and my first step was to fact check their responses. All facts checked out, although again GPT-4 gave more examples.\n\n\nSolving a math problem\n1st Place: GPT-4 & Claude\n2nd Place: …\n3rd Place: Gemini\nThe GPT-4 and Claude both got the answer correct, with slightly different descriptions. I initially was going to say GPT-4’s was better, but ultimately called it a tie since it was so close.\nGemini was was simply wrong, which I found surprising. Not only did it respond with the wrong answer (7) when it shared it’s reasoning it returned a different wrong answer of 3. I intentionally added some tricky wording to mess up the models, but still it was strange how it arrived at two different wrong answers.\n\n\nMargarita recipes\n1st Place: GPT-4 – 7.5/8 out of 10\nFollowed instructions, since simple syrup was optional I asked my wife and she declined. I worried the ratio of tequila to cointreau would be off. Her rating out of 10 was 7.5/8. She said oh that’s good and she liked how tart it was. She did mention it was a little strong, but still really liked it. She ended up adding some water, but again still enjoyed it.\n2nd Place: Gemini – 6.5 out of 10\nFollowed instructions. 7 out of 10 initially, dropped to 6.5 out of 10 quickly. Very strong otherwise really liked the flavors. Would have been an 8 if not as strong. Had to water it down significant.\n3rd Place: Claude – 6 out of 10\nFollowed instructions, left out basil. Quick 6 rating, a little too sweet. Syrupy was how she described it. Added water and it was a little better.\n\n\nFinal thoughts on the results\n1st Place: GPT-4 Clear winner across the board. It was the most consistent. I do use GPT-4 the most, so I wonder if I have naturally trained my prompts to work better with it.\n2nd Place: Claude\nThis was my first time using Claude, and it was easy and provided good results. I will continue to play around with it (especially since I have $9.86 in credits).\n3rd Place: Gemini The wrong answers for the math problem made this an easy decision. It is nice that they offer a free api key to rate-limited usage.\nNote:\nOne thing this process made me realize, I had a lot of copy and pasted code. I think I want to build out a personal python package with helper functions I can use. I have built a personal R package previously, ({learylib})[https://github.com/mleary/learylib]"

    "text": "A new project, migrating to Quarto and exploring OpenAI\nFirst, I had to include the above ChatGPT blog write-up once I read the lines “got me back into the keyboard clacking game” and “It’s like culinary amnesia”. That was just too great not to share. I am excited to kick-off a multiple-stage project leveraging Quarto, Github Actions, OpenAI, and a few other tools. So in case the above ChatGPT summary wasn’t clear, I will give a quick summary.\nYears ago, I started a simple personal website to save recipes my family liked. I would never remember which recipe I had used and then would scramble to try and find them again. I setup a simple process leveraging {rmarkdown}, a csv of data, and Github Actions. Fast forward a few years of not updating that process, and I started to get some security warnings from the old code base. At that point, I decided it was time to move the basic recipe website to my personal website (here) and that meant converting it to a new format you can find here.\n\nInitial Setup\nMy initial focus was just moving the old recipe website to my existing Quarto personal website. I wanted to keep the first iteration simple so I focused on :\n\nInstead of saving the data in a csv file in the repo, I moved the data to a Google Sheets page and accessed it with the {googlesheets4} package\nI upgraded the presentation from a basic table to a “fancier” one leveraging {gt} and {gtExtras}\nI added the new webpage as a drop down section in my existing personal website.\n\n\n\nFuture plans\nThis was just an initial start, focusing on the basic need to move the existing website. I have a few follow-on ideas I want to explore.\n\nLeveraging OpenAI to summarize cooking websites\nExploring GitHub actions to update the recipes page whenever I update the Google Sheets with recipe data\n\nThis would be a good chance to test using secrets with GitHub actions, something I have not done\n\nFigure out how to make a series of posts with Quarto blog\n\nSo a simple first step but I am looking forward to exploring GitHub actions and OpenAI in the coming weeks!"

    "text": "I initially wanted to use OpenAI to summarize cooking recipes I found online, but that presented some issues with permissions and webscraping. So instead, I pivoted and created a ‘new’ recipe with OpenAI directly. This also helps address a common issue I faced, which was remembering which online recipe we previously used.\nFirst thing up on my list was a recipe for healthy banana bread that my kids would enjoy. So my goal for this exercise was:\n\nUse OpenAI to generate the recipe and ingredients list, in a specific format\n\nFor this I used the GPT-4 model via the OpenAI API\n\nUse the generated recipe to make banana bread with my two daughters (Nora and Tess)\nUse OpenAI to generate an images of us making the recipe.\n\nSide Note: If you haven’t explored the world of prompt engineering with a 3.5 and 5.5 year old, I can’t explain the strange requests you might get. Also, I can’t say 3 and 5 year old, because the half year is apparently very important.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the recipe and the images, it was a lot of fun for us to work on it together! I’ll walk through some of the prompt engineering we explored along the way.\n\nSetting up the system and role prompts\nFirst step, we need to set up the system and user prompts that will control what we ask for and get back from OpenAI. I won’t go into depth on this topic here, but basically the the system prompt defines HOW the the AI model should respond, and the user prompt defines WHAT we are asking the AI model to do.\nIn this case, I am giving the AI model the role of a culinary expert who specializes in creating simple but delicious meals. The user prompt is a request for a recipe for healthy banana bread that kids will enjoy eating, with a preference for using sugar alternatives like honey or maple syrup.\n\nOur system prompt is as follows:\n\n\"You are a culinary expert who specializes in creating simple but delicious meals.  You will output a quick summary of the meal in a json format contain two key value pairs.  First, a key \"ingredients\" which has the list of ingredients. Second, a key \"steps\", which has a step-by-step process for cooking the meal. The preference is to create meals with common ingredients and as few as ingredients as needed.\"\n\n\n\nOur user prompt is as follows:\n\n\"I need a recipe for healthy banana bread, one that kids will enjoy eating.  I prefer to use sugar alternatives as much as possible, such as honey or maple syrup.\"\n\n\n\nhide / show code\nrole_system = '''\n\"You are a culinary expert who specializes in creating simple but delicious meals.  You will output a quick summary of the meal in a json format contain two key value pairs.  First, a key \"ingredients\" which has the list of ingredients. Second, a key \"steps\", which has a step-by-step process for cooking the meal. The preference is to create meals with common ingredients and as few as ingredients as needed.\"\n'''\n\nrole_user =\"I need a recipe for healthy banana bread, one that kids will enjoy eating.  I prefer to use sugar alternatives as much as possible, such as honey or maple syrup.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenAI to generate recipe and ingredients list\nNow that we have our system and user prompts set up, we can use OpenAI to generate the recipe and ingredients list for healthy banana bread. We will pass in the system and user prompts to the OpenAI API and get back a response with the generated data. We will then extract the data from the response and convert it into a Python object that we can work with.\n\nNote: I didn’t want to continually rerun the OPENAI API call, so I saved the result. This code doesn’t actually run now and I just open up the saved json file.\n\n\n\nhide / show code\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\nfrom secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY\nimport json\n\n# Create a completion with the OpenAI API\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)\n\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-0125-preview\",\n  response_format={ \"type\": \"json_object\" },\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": role_system},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": role_user}\n  ]\n)\n\n# Extract the generated data from the completion object\nresponse_data = completion.choices[0].message.content\n\n# Convert the JSON string into a Python object\ndata_dict = json.loads(response_data)\n\n#with open('data.json', 'w') as file:\n#    json.dump(data_dict, file)\n\n# Load the data from the saved file - I commented out the generation code above\nwith open('./data.json', 'r') as file:\n  data_dict = json.load(file)\n\n# extract the ingredients and steps from the data\ningredients = data_dict['ingredients']\ningredients_list = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {ingredient}\" for ingredient in ingredients)\n\nsteps = data_dict['steps']\nsteps_list = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {step}\" for step in steps)\n\n\nAnd now we have the recipe and ingredients list for healthy banana bread that kids will enjoy eating. Let’s take a look at the ingredients and recipe steps.\n\n\nThe Ingredients we need\n\n\nhide / show code\nimport json # need to import this since above code chunk does not execute\n\n# Load the data from the saved file - I commented out the generation code in the above code chunk\nwith open('./data.json', 'r') as file:\n  data_dict = json.load(file)\n\n# extract the ingredients and steps from the data\ningredients = data_dict['ingredients']\ningredients_list = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {ingredient}\" for ingredient in ingredients)\n\n\nprint(ingredients_list)\n\n\n- 3 ripe bananas\n- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil\n- 1/2 cup honey or maple syrup\n- 2 eggs\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 1/4 cup milk or a milk alternative\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n- 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour\n- Optional: 1/2 cup mix-ins such as chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or dried fruit\n\n\n\n\nThe Recipe instructions\n\n\nhide / show code\nsteps = data_dict['steps']\nsteps_list = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {step}\" for step in steps)\n\nprint(steps_list)\n\n\n- Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.\n- In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted coconut oil into the mashed bananas.\n- Mix in the honey or maple syrup, beaten eggs, and vanilla extract. Then mix in the milk.\n- Add the baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, and stir into the batter. Lastly, mix in the flour, just until combined. If you're adding any mix-ins, gently fold them in now.\n- Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan and sprinkle a little cinnamon on top for extra flavor.\n- Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.\n- Enjoy your healthy banana bread as is, or toast slices and serve with a spread of nut butter for an extra protein boost.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Recipe\nWe took those ingredients and recipe steps and made the recipe with my two daughters. Following the suggested process the result was as good as any store bought mixes or recipes we have found online!\n\n\nThe Image Generation\nAfter we made the recipe, we used OpenAI’s DALL-E to generate an image of the recipe being made. We used the following prompt to generate the image, courtesy of Nora::\n\n\"I want a cartoon image of a a father and his two daughters in their kitchen putting a dish into the oven with the healthy banana bread batter they just made.  The two daughter are Nora and Tess, Nora is wearing a sparkly dress and Tess is wearing  paw patrol shirt with pink pants.\"\n\n\n\nhide / show code\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\n#from secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.images.generate(\n  model=\"dall-e-3\",\n  prompt= 'I want a cartoon image of a a father and his two daughters  in their kitchen putting a dish into the oven with the healthy banana bread batter they just made.  The two daughter are Nora and Tess, Nora is wearing a sparkly dress and Tess is wearing  paw patrol shirt with pink pants.' ,\n  size=\"1024x1024\",\n  quality=\"standard\",\n  n=1,\n)\n\nimage_url = response.data[0].url  \n\n\n\nNora’s Image\nI used Nora’s prompt as image for this article.\n\n\n\nMy image\nI also create an image, but lost the prompt. It included me wearing Tottenham Hotspur gear is the main thing I remember.\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost of exploration\nLooking back, the total cost to generate the recipe and images was about $0.57. That includes multiple attempts refining my process to request the recipe and ingredients and generating 5 images with DALL-E. I think that is a pretty good deal for a fun afternoon with my daughters. I hope you enjoyed the recipe and images as much as we did!"

    "text": "Using Open AI for image generation\nAs I expected, it was incredibly easy to use the Open AI api with just a few lines of code. Each each call only cost a few pennies (I saw 3-4 cents per image) and took 5-10 seconds to return a response. So overall, very inexpensive and quick to iterate with new different images.\nI started with a vague prompt about a bear saying “please bear with me”, and slowly refined it.\n\n\nhide / show code\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\nfrom secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.images.generate(\n  model=\"dall-e-3\",\n  prompt=\"I want a picture of a bear in construction gear sitting at a computer typing code.

A few things to note that I found interesting:\n\nAs of February 2024, the image will stay up for one hour per the DALL-E documentation.\nYou’ll notice that while the image outputs are impressive, the text generation was surprisingly bad. Even with direct prompts to include a specific saying, it often got the phrase wrong, misspelled words or even made up words. Some quick research confirmed it’s a common occurrence. I read some explanations for why, but I did not go deep enough to confirm exactly why. I am interested to read more on that."
