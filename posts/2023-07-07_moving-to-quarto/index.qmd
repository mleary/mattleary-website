After many months (years?) of not really touching my personal website, I am working to update my website and *truly* delve into using [quarto](https://quarto.org/) for analysis and publication. This initial post will be a short summary of my efforts to get started, document some of the resources I found and used, and a starting point for what will \*hopefully\* become a regularly updated post.

### Lessons learned

-   I had an existing template, after a few hours I was able to follow Sam Csik tutorial (to help me create blog section on the website.
    -   [Used this tutorial](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)
-   Using a custom domain is relatively simple, but it took some configuring to get it right.
    -   [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
        -   Used the section entitled **Configuring an apex domain**
    -   [Random YouTube video that helped visual the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgEWWBvIxY)
-   Realized I might want to setup a Github Actions workflow instead of rendering locally. Not sure on that yet.
-   Consolidating
    -   I have created several other websites with Github. Debating if I want to link to those, move that content into this website, or refactor those as quarto webpages.
