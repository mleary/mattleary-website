After many months (years?) of not really touching my personal website, I am working to update my website and *truly* delve into using [quarto](https://quarto.org/) for analysis and publication. This initial post will be a short summary of my efforts to get started, document some of the resources I found and used, and a starting point for what will \*hopefully\* become a regularly updated post.

### Lessons learned

-   I had an existing template, after a few hours I was able to follow Sam Csik tutorial (below) to help me create blog section on the website.
