Therefore, you have 7 apples and 3 bananas, giving a total of 10 fruits. Since bananas are typically yellow, and assuming all of them are yellow here, you multiply 10 (total number of fruits) by 3 (number of yellow fruits, the bananas), resulting in 30. Next, you divide this number by 4 (the number of legs on a cow) to get 7.5. Rounding 7.5 up to the nearest prime number gives 11.", "claude-math": "The answer to your question is 11.
