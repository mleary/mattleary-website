Admittedly, I am late to exploring image geneartion with Dall-E.  As I look to revive my efforts to write posts exploring the rapidly changing world of Generative AI.  This will be a quick post, but I recently explored adding 

```{python}
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY

client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)

response = client.images.generate(
  model="dall-e-3",
  prompt="I want a picture of a bear in construction gear sitting at a computer typing code.  I want a message at the top of the image that says 'Please BEAR with us, this site is under construction. The idea is for this to be cartoonish and funny!  Please add this exact phrase at the bottom 'Created with Dall-E'",
  size="1024x1024",
  quality="standard",
  n=1,
)

image_url = response.data[0].url
image_url
```
