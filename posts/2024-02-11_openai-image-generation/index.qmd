## Background on the idea

Admittedly, I am late to exploring image geneartion with Dall-E.  But as they say, better late then never! I wanted to quickly post on some recent exploration using Open AI api with Dall-E.

I had a section of my website for data notes, to capture useful code snippets, new packages, and even techniques I haven't used much.  I saw a similiar idea on someone elses blog and thought it was a great idea.  That said, I have yet to populate it with anything.  So for the short term, I figured why not create an image of bear saying something like "Please BEAR with us" to announce the site was under construction.  A very normal and commonsense idea in my eyes.


## Using Open AI for image generation




```{python}
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from secret_keys import OPENAI_KEY

client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)

response = client.images.generate(
  model="dall-e-3",
  prompt="I want a picture of a bear in construction gear sitting at a computer typing code.  I want a message at the top of the image that says 'Please BEAR with us, this site is under construction. The idea is for this to be cartoonish and funny!  Please add this exact phrase at the bottom 'Created with Dall-E'",
  size="1024x1024",
  quality="standard",
  n=1,
)

image_url = response.data[0].url
image_url
```


# data notes

A simple place to notes on data related "things.


### This page is under construction, please bear with us.

### Obviously, I only need one image but I created six with OpenAI and Dall E so wanted to share them all!
