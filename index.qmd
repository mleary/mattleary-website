## Welcome!

I am a data scientist, Tottenham Hotspur fan, Veteran, and proud minivan owner. I created this website to share my work and help future Matt find code snippets and remember how I did things.

I built this site with [quarto](https://quarto.org/), and have used it as a chance to revamp an [older website](https://github.com/mleary/blogdown) built with Hugo & [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org)

For information on me, feel free to visit the [about_me](about.html) section to get a brief bio and find links to my LinkedIn, Github page, and current resume.
