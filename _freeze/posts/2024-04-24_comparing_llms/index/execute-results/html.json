OpenAI has the GPT series, Google has Gemini, and Anthropic has Claude, and there are others like Llama 3 available for use. While their performance benchmarks may appear similar at first glance, understanding the nuances of each or the trade-offs between them can be challenging. \n\nThis comparison aims to shed light on these differences, providing a clearer picture of their respective strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately guiding us in choosing the right tool for our specific needs. I should note, I use the term `comparison` loosely, as I am not rigorously comparing the models but informally seeing how they perform on a specific task.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why I've chosen to spotlight OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini. Well, let's just say my MacBook isn't exactly a heavyweight champion. It's more of a featherweight, really. Running a behemoth like Llama 3 on it would be like asking a Chihuahua to pull a sled. It's just not going to end well.\n\nSo, I've decided to stick to the models that come with a handy API service. It's like having a personal butler for your LLM needs. No heavy lifting, no sweat, and most importantly, no MacBook meltdowns. So, let's dive in and see what these API-served LLMs have to offer!\n\n### Quick note\n\nOutside of the comparing the results section, almost all of this text was generated by GitHub CoPilot, ChatGPT, and the LLMs referenced in this post. I merely prompted various AIs and accepted most of what they wrote, with minimal editing.  Including this paragraph. \n\n::: {#b3fe00a7 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code .code-overflow-wrap code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"hide / show helper functions and imports\"}\n# Importing necessary libraries \nimport textwrap\nimport json\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\n\n# Setting up helper functions to save output (so I don't have to rerun constantly and print out text)\ndef to_markdown(text):\n  text = text.replace('•', '  *')\n  return Markdown(textwrap.indent(text, '> ', predicate=lambda _: True))\n\nimport json\n\ndef save_text_output_to_json(text_name, text_output, filename):\n    data = {}\n    try:\n        with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n\n    data[text_name] = text_output\n\n    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(data, f)\n\ndef read_text_output_from_json(text_name, filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n    return data.get(text_name, \"\")\n\n\n# function to print json generated later on\ndef print_epl_as_markdown(json_string):\n  data = json.loads(json_string)\n\n  # Print players as a bulleted list\n  print(\"Top 3 Players:\")\n  for key, value in data['players'].items():\n    print(f\"{key} - {value}\")\n\n  # Print reason as a string\n  print('')\n  print(\"Reason:\")\n  print(data['reason'])\n\nsystem_prompt = \"You are a helpful assistant that is tasked with describing yourself, the Large Language Models built by your  parent company.

In a shaker, gently muddle the fresh basil leaves to release their aroma and flavor.\n> 2. Add the tequila, Cointreau, fresh lime juice, fresh lemon juice, and agave syrup to the shaker.\n> 3. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds to ensure all ingredients are well combined and chilled.\n> 4. Fill a rocks glass with fresh ice.\n> 5. Strain the margarita mixture over the ice in the rocks glass.\n> 6. Garnish with a sprig of fresh basil or a lime wheel, if desired.\n> \n> The bartending expert notes that the addition of fresh basil and a touch of lemon juice creates a refreshing and slightly herbaceous twist on the classic margarita. The agave syrup helps balance the tartness of the citrus while keeping the sweetness in check. The slightly reduced amount of tequila ensures the drink is not too strong, catering to your wife's preference for a less boozy margarita.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Google's Gemini**\n\n::: {#61ea4fa4 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code .code-overflow-wrap code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"hide / show code\"}\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nfrom secret_keys import GEMINI_KEY\ngenai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_KEY)\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')\nresponse = model.generate_content(marg_system_prompt)\n\nsave_text_output_to_json('gemini-marg', response.text, 'completions.json')\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#7e0cc898 .cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.python .cell-code .code-overflow-wrap code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"hide / show code\"}\ntext = read_text_output_from_json('gemini-marg', 'completions.json')\nto_markdown(text)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=16}\n> **Ingredients:**\n> \n> * 1 1/2 ounces Casamigos Blanco Tequila\n> * 1 ounce Camarena Silver Tequila\n> * 1/2 ounce Cointreau\n> * 1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice\n> * 1/4 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice\n> * Rocks\n> * Garnish: Lime wheel\n> \n> **Steps:**\n> \n> * Fill a shaker with ice.\n> * Add the Casamigos Blanco Tequila, Camarena Silver Tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and lemon juice to the shaker.\n> * Seal the shaker and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.\n> * Strain the cocktail over ice into an Old Fashioned glass.\n> * Garnish with a lime wheel and serve.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Informal Conclusion\n\n### Best EPL Playerse\n\n**1st Place:** GPT-4\n\n**2nd Place:**  Claude\n\n**3rd Place:** Gemini\n\n**All Tied**\n\nThis question was almost a three-way tie, as all three models provided the similar answers.  Ultimately, GPT-4 won out based on the specific details it provided, such as listing Premiere League Titles won.  Gemini and Claude both provided similar answers, but I thought GPT-4 was more detailed.\n\nThey all selected Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer, and then Ryan Giggs (Claude) and Cristiano Ronaldo (GPT and Gemini).  I was surprised by the results, and my first step was to fact check their responses. All facts checked out, although again GPT-4 gave more examples. \n\n\n### Solving a math problem\n\n**1st Place:** GPT-4 & Claude\n\n**2nd Place:**  ...\n\n**3rd Place:** Gemini\n\nThe GPT-4 and Claude both got the answer correct, with slightly different descriptions.  I initially was going to say GPT-4's was better, but ultimately called it a tie since it was so close.\n\nGemini was was simply wrong, which I found surprising. Not only did it respond with the wrong answer (7) when it shared it's reasoning it returned a different wrong answer of 3. I intentionally added some tricky wording to mess up the models, but still it was strange how it arrived at two different wrong answers.\n\n\n### Margarita recipes\n\n**1st Place:** GPT-4 -- 7.5/8 out of 10\n\nFollowed instructions, since simple syrup was optional I asked my wife and she declined.  I worried the ratio of tequila to cointreau would be off.  Her rating out of 10 was 7.5/8.  She said oh that's good and she liked how tart it was. She did mention it was a little strong, but still really liked it. She ended up adding some water, but again still enjoyed it. \n\n**2nd Place:** Gemini -- 6.5 out of 10\n\nFollowed instructions.  7 out of 10 initially, dropped to 6.5 out of 10 quickly.  Very strong otherwise really liked the flavors. Would have been an 8 if not as strong. Had to water it down significant.\n\n\n**3rd Place:** Claude -- 6 out of 10\n\nFollowed instructions, left out basil. Quick 6 rating, a little too sweet. Syrupy was how she described it. Added water and it was a little better.  \n\n \n\n### Final thoughts on the results\n\n**1st Place:** GPT-4\nClear winner across the board.  It was the most consistent.  I do use GPT-4 the most, so I wonder if I have naturally trained my prompts to work better with it.  \n\n**2nd Place:** Claude\n\nThis was my first time using Claude, and it was easy and provided good results.  I will continue to play around with it (especially since I have $9.86 in credits).\n\n**3rd Place:** Gemini\nThe wrong answers for the math problem made this an easy decision.  It is nice that they offer a free api key to rate-limited usage.\n\n**Note:**\n\nOne thing this process made me realize, I had a lot of copy and pasted code.  I think I want to build out a personal python package with helper functions I can use.  I have built a personal R package previously, ({learylib})[https://github.com/mleary/learylib]\n\n## Generating an image for this blog post\n\nI used OpenAI's DALL-E-3 model to generate an image for this blog post.
