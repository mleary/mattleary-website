Hi!

I am a data scientist working in the insurance industry, and I enjoy building tools that help people work more efficiently. Outside of work, I am the proud father of two tiny humans and an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan. I previously worked in public policy/public relations, and spent a few years in the Army\*.

\*Fun fact, you run and workout a LOT less when no one is yelling at you to do so.
