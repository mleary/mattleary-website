After 10+ years working in public relations / government services, I moved into data science after realizing I preferred working with data to summarizing it. I am still expanding my knowledge of all things data & tech, and find myself focused on building data science solutions AND learning how we can deploy and integrate them into other applications. I started coding in `R`, but have slowly adopt `Python` as well.
