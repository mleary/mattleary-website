## Why create a recipes website?

I am terrible at saving / remembering which recipes we have used and liked. My spouse has grown tired of me asking for the link to the same recipe again and again.

This is a quick attempt to save cooking recipes to a simple website I can control. And on the plus side, versus saving links in a browser or Notepad, this means I can access the recipes from anywhere.

```{r, collapse=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
library(googlesheets4)
library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(gtExtras)
library(fontawesome)

fontawesome::fa_html_dependency()

# Only need to use this when setting it up for the first time on a computer
#gs4_auth()

google_sheets_path <- Sys.getenv("GSHEETS_PATH")
sheet <- read_sheet(google_sheets_path)

sheet <- sheet %>%
  mutate(Recipe = paste0("[", Recipe, "](", Website, ")")) %>%
  select(-Website)

gt_table <- gt(sheet) %>%
  tab_header('Recipes we like')  %>%
  cols_width(
    Recipe ~ pct(25),
    `Kids Rating` ~ pct(20),
    `Adult Rating` ~ pct(20),
    Notes ~ pct(35)
  ) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = c(Recipe))  %>%
  gtExtras::gt_fa_rating(`Kids Rating`, icon='thumbs-up', color = 'red') %>%
  gtExtras::gt_fa_rating(`Adult Rating`, icon='thumbs-up', color = 'blue')%>%
  gtExtras::gt_theme_espn()


gt_table
```
